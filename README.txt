- Need to import these to run the code successfully:
(import numpy as np, import pandas as pd, from matplotlib import pyplot as plt, from itertools import combinations, chain)

- Developed on Pychram, with python 2.7 version

- Need to have the (Data.csv)in the same folder of the project to correctly read it

- Takes some time to get the results written on the report, so just be patient please and 
let the code run :) 

- The plots are viewed fully when make the window bigger
